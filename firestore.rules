/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and role-based access control for roles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /roles/{roleId}: Stores role definitions.
 * - /user_roles/{userId}: Stores user role assignments.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data.
 * - Role creation and management is restricted (TODO: needs implementation).
 * - User roles are assigned based on the existence of documents in the `/user_roles/{userId}` collection.
 * - List operations are allowed for users to view their roles.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - User ownership is enforced by matching `request.auth.uid` against the `userId` path parameter, avoiding `get()` calls to user documents.
